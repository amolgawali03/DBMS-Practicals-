Q7. Employee–Department Management System

Tables: EMPLOYEE(emp_id, emp_name, salary, dept_id)

DEPARTMENT(dept_id, dept_name, location)

Problem Statements (JOIN Queries)

1.	Display all employee details along with their department names using INNER JOIN.
2.	List all employees and their departments, including employees who are not assigned to any department (LEFT OUTER JOIN).
3.	List all departments and their employees, including departments without employees (RIGHT OUTER JOIN).
4.	Retrieve all departments and employees, showing unmatched records from both tables (FULL OUTER JOIN).
5.	Generate a Cartesian product of EMPLOYEE and DEPARTMENT (CROSS JOIN) to display every possible combination.
6.	Display employee names and corresponding department locations using JOIN with WHERE condition.
7.	List all employees working in departments located in “Nashik”.
8.	Display department-wise total salary of employees using JOIN and aggregation.

CREATE DATABASE EmpDeptDB;
USE EmpDeptDB;

-- Create Department table
CREATE TABLE DEPARTMENT (
  dept_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  dept_name VARCHAR(50),
  location VARCHAR(50)
);

-- Create Employee table
CREATE TABLE EMPLOYEE (

-- Insert sample departments
INSERT INTO DEPARTMENT VALUES
(1, 'IT', 'Pune'),
(2, 'HR', 'Mumbai'),
(3, 'Accounts', 'Nashik'),
(4, 'Sales', 'Delhi');

-- Insert sample employees
INSERT INTO EMPLOYEE VALUES
(101, 'Amit', 50000, 1),
(102, 'Sneha', 45000, 2),
(103, 'Raj', 55000, 1),
(104, 'Tina', 40000, 3),
(105, 'Karan', 35000, NULL); -- Not assigned to any dept

-- 1️⃣ INNER JOIN – Employees with their department names
SELECT e.emp_name, e.salary, d.dept_name
FROM EMPLOYEE e
INNER JOIN DEPARTMENT d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id;

-- 2️⃣ LEFT JOIN – All employees (even without department)
SELECT e.emp_name, d.dept_name
FROM EMPLOYEE e
LEFT JOIN DEPARTMENT d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id;

-- 3️⃣ RIGHT JOIN – All departments (even without employees)
SELECT e.emp_name, d.dept_name
FROM EMPLOYEE e
RIGHT JOIN DEPARTMENT d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id;

-- 4️⃣ FULL OUTER JOIN (not directly supported in MySQL)
-- Use UNION of LEFT and RIGHT JOIN
SELECT e.emp_name, d.dept_name
FROM EMPLOYEE e
LEFT JOIN DEPARTMENT d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id
UNION
SELECT e.emp_name, d.dept_name
FROM EMPLOYEE e
RIGHT JOIN DEPARTMENT d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id;

-- 5️⃣ CROSS JOIN – Cartesian product (all combinations)
SELECT e.emp_name, d.dept_name
FROM EMPLOYEE e
CROSS JOIN DEPARTMENT d;

-- 6️⃣ JOIN with WHERE condition – Employee names with department location
SELECT e.emp_name, d.location
FROM EMPLOYEE e
JOIN DEPARTMENT d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id
WHERE d.location = 'Pune';

-- 7️⃣ Employees working in departments located in “Nashik”
SELECT e.emp_name, d.dept_name
FROM EMPLOYEE e
JOIN DEPARTMENT d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id
WHERE d.location = 'Nashik';

-- 8️⃣ Department-wise total salary using JOIN and aggregation
SELECT d.dept_name, SUM(e.salary) AS Total_Salary
FROM EMPLOYEE e
JOIN DEPARTMENT d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id
GROUP BY d.dept_name;
