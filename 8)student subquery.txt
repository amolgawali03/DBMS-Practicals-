Q8. Student Result Management System
Tables:
•	STUDENT(student_id, student_name, department, age)
•	RESULT(student_id, subject, marks)
Problem Statements (Subquery-Based Queries)
1.	Display names of students who have scored more than average marks in all subjects (single-row subquery).
2.	Retrieve students whose marks are equal to the maximum marks in the ‘DBMS’ subject (single-row subquery).
3.	Display names of students whose marks are greater than all students from the IT department (multi-row subquery with ALL).
4.	Display student details who are not enrolled in any result record (using subquery with NOT IN).
5.	List subjects in which student “Sneha Joshi” scored more than 80 marks (nested subquery).
